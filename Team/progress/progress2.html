				<h4>Week 2:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 1/21/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 30<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
				<p>My main goals for the week were to get more familiar with Unity, and to be able to create movable
					arms within Unity. Since the arm relies on making a simulation for its movements, this task was top
					priority to me.</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Unity</p>
				<p>To get started with Unity and VR development, I did a couple tutorials teaching me how to interface
					the headset and controllers within the workspace. This also showed me a variety of features unity
					provides with object creation and management.</p>


				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Creating Robot Arms</p>
				<p>After learning a bit about how VR development works within Unity, I started making a simple arm. For
					this arm, I followed some tutorials on Inverse Kinematics within Unity to figure out how to create
					this arm. I wrote two scripts, IKmanager.cs to calculate the overall Inverse Kinematics in 2D, and
					LookAt.cs, to track the position of the target and "look" at it, which allows the arm to track a
					target in 3D. </p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week2/firstarm.png" />
				<p>After doing that, I remade the arm to give it a more 3D look, as well as to sharpen my skills in
					creating arms. </p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week2/earlyarm.gif" />
				<p>These two arms seemed to work well, and will probably be used to test our base level arm since they
					have the same number of joints and rotation axis. However, one of my goals for the project was to
					create an arm simulation that allowed for more control, and these two didnt allow for much other
					than location tracking. What I wanted was rotational tracking in all axis as well. To do this, I
					decided to not spend time trying extremely complex inverse kinematics for multiple targets, so I
					instead looked to unity packages that can handle this part for me. Here's an example of one attempt
					that took way too long to get working.</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week2/2ndarm.gif" />
				<p>Unfortunately, this arm would only work inside a simulation, since once of the joints is unable to
					move properly on one axis. My search continued, with lots of testing, and I eventually found a
					package that easily allowed me to create a simulation with Inverse Kinematics for multiple targets.
					This current arm is the goal for the project, if we can succeed at adding extra joints to our robot
					arm.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week2/4tharm.gif" />
				<p>This arm feels very natural to use, so I think the only changes to this arm will be to make it look
					nicer. Mechanically, the arm simulation seems to be done.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>Overall, I've learned a lot about Unity, and how to create software for VR devices. There are a lot
					of complications that I had to work out, but those occur less now that I have more experience.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>My goals for next week are to work out the networking for Unity, which we started a bit of this week,
					but I think could be fully finished by the end of the next week. This would allow for the simulation
					to communicate to the server, and then hopefully the server communicating to the real arm.

				<h4>Week 3:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 1/28/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 20<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
				<p>My main goals for the week were to get the Unity simulation to fully be able to send all the data it
					needs to to the server. This is important because the entire point of the simulation is to send the
					angular data to the server.</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Connecting Unity to web server</p>
				<p>With help from Matthew, I managed to get a websocket set up in Unity, allowing us to send the data
					from the simulation to the server. It works well, but does have some little problems, like lag when
					too much data is sent. (Like if the arm moves too fast) These should be easily fixable, thankfully.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week3/CurrentArm.gif" />
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Getting robot claw to work</p>
				<p>The next step was to figure out how to find how much the trigger is being pressed. Through a bit of
					research into unities libraries, I found a way to track it. I created a custom game object with a
					script to track the percent the trigger is pressed, and relayed that information to the connection
					script. So now Joint 8 is being broadcasted to the server.</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week3/Joint8.gif" />
				<p>After doing that, I made a custom model to get an animation of the claw. This claw has a script that
					reads from the trigger game object, and uses that percent pressed value to determine how much the
					claws need to move. </p>
				<img style="width: 40%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week3/ClawAnimation.gif" />
				<img style="width: 40%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week3/Claw.gif" />
				<p>Now the robot arm actually feels like something that can pick up and move objects, and technically
					could if the physical arm was connected at this point.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>This week, I learned more about how Unity works, and learned how websockets/TCP connections work.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>My goals for next week are to get the arm controllable without having to move the controller right to
					the tip of the claw. This would allow for easier movements of the arm, and actually controlling the
					arm simulation from distances. I also want to make a virtual demo of the arm, complete with objects
					to pick up. Also adding a menu to show/hide certain elements from the simulation is something I want
					to look into.
