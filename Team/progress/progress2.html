				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
				<p>My main goals for the week were to get more familiar with Unity, and to be able to create movable
					arms within Unity. Since the arm relies on making a simulation for its movements, this task was top
					priority to me.</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Unity</p>
				<p>To get started with Unity and VR development, I did a couple tutorials teaching me how to interface
					the headset and controllers within the workspace. This also showed me a variety of features unity
					provides with object creation and management.</p>


				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Creating Robot Arms</p>
				<p>After learning a bit about how VR development works within Unity, I started making a simple arm. For
					this arm, I followed some tutorials on Inverse Kinematics within Unity to figure out how to create
					this arm. I wrote two scripts, IKmanager.cs to calculate the overall Inverse Kinematics in 2D, and
					LookAt.cs, to track the position of the target and "look" at it, which allows the arm to track a
					target in 3D. </p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week2/firstarm.png" />
				<p>After doing that, I remade the arm to give it a more 3D look, as well as to sharpen my skills in
					creating arms. </p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week2/earlyarm.gif" />
				<p>These two arms seemed to work well, and will probably be used to test our base level arm since they
					have the same number of joints and rotation axis. However, one of my goals for the project was to
					create an arm simulation that allowed for more control, and these two didnt allow for much other
					than location tracking. What I wanted was rotational tracking in all axis as well. To do this, I
					decided to not spend time trying extremely complex inverse kinematics for multiple targets, so I
					instead looked to unity packages that can handle this part for me. Here's an example of one attempt
					that took way too long to get working.</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week2/2ndarm.gif" />
				<p>Unfortunately, this arm would only work inside a simulation, since once of the joints is unable to
					move properly on one axis. My search continued, with lots of testing, and I eventually found a
					package that easily allowed me to create a simulation with Inverse Kinematics for multiple targets.
					This current arm is the goal for the project, if we can succeed at adding extra joints to our robot
					arm.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week2/4tharm.gif" />
				<p>This arm feels very natural to use, so I think the only changes to this arm will be to make it look
					nicer. Mechanically, the arm simulation seems to be done.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>Overall, I've learned a lot about Unity, and how to create software for VR devices. There are a lot
					of complications that I had to work out, but those occur less now that I have more experience.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>My goals for next week are to work out the networking for Unity, which we started a bit of this week,
					but I think could be fully finished by the end of the next week. This would allow for the simulation
					to communicate to the server, and then hopefully the server communicating to the real arm.

				<h4>Week 3:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 1/28/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 20<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
				<p>My main goals for the week were to get the Unity simulation to fully be able to send all the data it
					needs to the server. This is important because the entire point of the simulation is to send the
					angular data to the server.</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Connecting Unity to web server</p>
				<p>With help from Matthew, I managed to get a websocket set up in Unity, allowing us to send the data
					from the simulation to the server. It works well, but does have some little problems, like lag when
					too much data is sent. (Like if the arm moves too fast) These should be easily fixable, thankfully.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week3/CurrentArm.gif" />
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Getting robot claw to work</p>
				<p>The next step was to figure out how to find how much the trigger is being pressed. Through a bit of
					research into unities libraries, I found a way to track it. I created a custom game object with a
					script to track the percent the trigger is pressed, and relayed that information to the connection
					script. So now Joint 8 is being broadcasted to the server.</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week3/Joint8.gif" />
				<p>After doing that, I made a custom model to get an animation of the claw. This claw has a script that
					reads from the trigger game object, and uses that percent pressed value to determine how much the
					claws need to move. </p>
				<img style="width: 50%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week3/ClawAnimation.gif" />
				<img style="width: 40%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week3/Claw.gif" />
				<p>Now the robot arm actually feels like something that can pick up and move objects, and technically
					could if the physical arm was connected at this point.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>This week, I learned more about how Unity works, and learned how websockets/TCP connections work.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>My goals for next week are to get the arm controllable without having to move the controller right to
					the tip of the claw. This would allow for easier movements of the arm, and actually controlling the
					arm simulation from distances. I also want to make a virtual demo of the arm, complete with objects
					to pick up. Also adding a menu to show/hide certain elements from the simulation is something I want
					to look into.

				<h4>Week 4:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 2/4/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 35<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
				<p>My main goal for the week was to create a small demo for the arm within unity, while improving
					existing scripts.</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Creating the demo</p>
				<p>I created a small scene with some objects on a table that the arm is able to grab. Each object has
					physics, so the arm can interact with the scene just like a real life arm could interact with real
					life objects. While the physics are a little wonky, I think this is a good demo for showing how to
					use the simulation.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week4/Demo.png" />
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">New Scripts</p>
				<p>I created a bunch of new scripts to help with this demo, and some to improve the general use of the
					arm:</p>
				<p>AllowClawToGrab.cs - This script is a big one, and required a lot of fine tuning and obscure
					knowledge of how Unity works. What this does is allows the claw to "grab" objects to showcase what
					the real arm should be able to do. The script checks certain collision polygons on the arm while its
					closing, and if those polygons intersect an object, it will stick the object to the claw, and stop
					the claw from closing any more. This gives the illusion of the claw grabbing the object. When the
					user lets go of the trigger, the claw opens, and drops the object. The object is also given
					velocities to reflect how the arm was moving the object. This script is a little glitchy since
					unity's physics system doesn't really like collisions between two physics objects very well, but it
					works well enough for a demo
					to showcase the
					simulation.</p>
				<p>RemoteControl.cs - This script allows the user to remotely control the robot arm target. By holding a
					button on the controller, the user gets full control of the target, and can move it without bringing
					the controller all the way to the target.</p>
				<p>Reset.cs - This script allows the user to reset all of the objects in the demo scene by pressing a
					button on the controller. This is helpful because when playing the demo, it is very easy for objects
					to become too far away from the arm.</p>
				<p>LimitRotation.cs - This script limits the amount the target can be rotated, as an extra layer of
					protection for the joint limits.</p>
				<p>General Ignore Collision Scripts - These scripts help stop things going crazy by disabling collisions
					with certain objects like the player object and some parts of the arm. </p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Modified Scripts</p>
				<p>I also modified a few of my existing scripts to work better: </p>
				<p>TriggerGrip.cs (Trigger button to control claw) - Changed the way the trigger controls the claw,
					added acceleration to the claw movements and gave it more precision. </p>
				<p>Connection.cs (connection to server) - Reduced the number of bytes the JSON packet needs to send.
					Added an epoch timestamp for synchronization. </p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>This week, I continued to learn more about how Unity works. (especially how rotation works in 3D)
					Making all of these scripts is good practice for when I need to make the more important scripts,
					like adding the 3D cameras into Unity when we get a hold of it.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>My goals for next week are to better synchronize the timestamps from Unity's connection script with
					the Raspberry Pi's timestamp. Right now, our latency is much lower than the limit we've set for
					ourselves, but our epoch timestamps are offset by a couple seconds. I also want to look into
					limiting the number of joints in the simulation, to see if we really need all 8 joints for the arm
					to work naturally. I also want to keep improving my existing scripts, in order to make everything as
					smooth and modifiable as possible. I want to add some sort of debug menu within the game, that
					allows me to change aspects of the simulation on the fly. (joint limits, remote control speed, show
					demo, etc.)

				<h4>Week 5:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 2/11/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 15<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Synopsis</p>
				<p>This week, I optimized some scripts, started on the debug menu, and changed the number of joints on
					the arm.

				</p>
				<p>
					First, I did a bit of bug-fixing to make the simulation run faster and transmit data better.
					Previously for reasons unknown the firebase was updating slowly when transmitting data from the lab
					PC and standalone VR headset. What I figured out was that it was a mix of unoptimized scripts and
					Wi-Fi latency. I’ve properly optimized the scripts, and we bought a USB-C to ethernet adapter for
					the headset if Wi-Fi is ever a problem.
					For the debug menu, I started working on it. This took a lot of research into how Oculus does UI
					handling, so it was a lot of guessing and checking what worked and what didn’t. I ended up getting
					it working, and all I need to do now is add features to it.
					For the robot arm, I changed the simulation to only use 7 joints, which means that we only need to
					add one extra motor to the robot arm. I’ve found by testing that this joint was somewhat redundant,
					and doesn’t change the functionality that much.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Optimizing</p>
				<p>This week, I worked on optimizing the general scripts I used, as it was clear that some of these had
					some less than ideal complexity levels. The main problem this was causing is that the standalone VR
					headset was transmitting data very slowly, which is against one of our PSSCs. I found that the main
					culprit was actually an optimization I made to limit the amount of data being sent to the server, by
					only sending it every hundredth of a millisecond, as opposed to as fast as possible. This ended up
					lagging the program due to the calculations I was doing. I removed this, and added a different
					optimization and now it works as well as the more powerful computer I was testing with.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Debug Menu</p>
				<p>I started work on the debug menu, which took a much longer time than expected. This required a lot of
					tutorials, and forum posts to get working. Eventually, I figured it out. While this is currently
					just a debug menu to toggle features, I think that this is the start of a main menu, and various UI
					elements the simulation definitely needs.</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week5/debug.png" />
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Robot Arm</p>
				<p>Previously, we thought that the robot would need two extra joints to work well, bringing it to 8
					total joints. I found that the 4th joint is somewhat redundant, since joint 6 does most of the same
					work. I locked the joint to 0 rotation, and it looks like I was correct. Going forward, we are going
					to be only using 7 joints, since it will be much easier to make mechanically.</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week5/no4thjoint.jpg" />
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>I learned this week that I have to be smart about what I'm writing in my scripts, since I see now
					that they can cause performance issues. I also learned how UI works with oculus controllers, which
					will be important for later.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>Next week, I plan to work on the debug menu further, and more UI elements in general. Maybe if the Pi
					camera gets sent to the server I can work on that, but I currently don’t know the ETA on that.

				<h4>Week 6:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 2/18/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Synopsis</p>
				<p>This week, I did a bunch of work with making the debug menu / main menu work properly with the
					simulation. Basically, I just added a bunch of features to the menu. I also added a menu for
					controls, so people other than me can understand how to use the controllers. I also created a logo
					for the team's name.

				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Menu</p>
				<p>I added a bunch of features to the menu, along with making sure that they actually worked. This
					required changing scripts and adding a workaround to make everything work as needed.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week6/menu.png" />
				<p>Here is a rundown of what each thing does:</p>
				<p>Box Stacking Demo - Toggles all of the objects from the "box stacking demo" which is just a huge arm
					with some boxes you can stack on top of eachother.</p>
				<p>Table Demo - Toggles the original demo, the table with a couple objects that you can interact with.
				</p>
				<p>Joint Text Data - Toggles the list of rotational angles of the joints.</p>
				<p>Main Arm Toggle - Turns the arm on/off.</p>
				<p>Server Connection - Toggles the connection to the server.</p>
				<p>Controls Menu - Toggles the controls menu.</p>
				<p>Main arm RC Multiplier - This slider controls how fast you want the remote control to move the
					target. Higher values means that you have to move your arm less to make the target move.</p>
				<p>Main Arm RC Rotation Lock - This is a bit confusing, but it snaps the rotation of the target to the
					controller. With it off, the arm will not snap, and will allow you to control the rotation of the
					arm without it snapping to your rotation. (It can get very hard to control with
					it off)</p>
				<p>Instant Claw - If on, will make the claw move instantly with the trigger, instead of an acceleration
					effect.
				</p>
				<p>Test Arm - Makes the arm move by itself, somewhat like a demo. This can be used to show the arm
					moving without having to control it.</p>
				<p>Here is a gif of what the animation looks like:</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week6/auto.gif" />
				<p>Reset Target - Reset the target to the default position. Good if it bugs out or is moved too far
					away.</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Logo</p>
				<p>I spent a little while creating a "logo" for the project. We decided to change names from "VRms" to
					"VRm" because we only have one arm. Feel free to let us know how you like it!</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week6/Vrm.png" />
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>I learned more about UI in Unity this week. I also learned more about scripting too, since I had to
					do a bunch of little modifications to get the UI working with the objects in the simulation.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>Next week, I hope to start working on the video streaming side of the project, but if not, I can
					continue to make improvements on the simulation.

				<b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Synopsis</p>
				<p>I didn't do too much this week, since I'm mainly waiting on the camera to get set up from Matt or
					Emma getting the arm to work with the microcontroller. What I did do, was add a limits menu to
					further control the arm settings while in the simulation. This is helpful so that you don't need to
					keep ending the simulation to tweak a small value.

				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Limit Menu</p>
				<p> This is the menu that I created to control the first 5 joints.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week7/LimitMenu.png" />
				<p> For each joint, there are 5 settings:
				</p>
				<p> Max/Min sliders - Controls the maximum/minimum degrees a joint can move between. Between -180 and
					180 degrees.
				</p>
				<p> Reset button - Resets the sliders to their default values.
				</p>
				<p> Limits Enabled check box - Allows you to enable/disable the rotation limits.
				</p>
				<p> Lock to current rotation button - When pressed, sets the Max/Min sliders to the joints current
					rotation, locking it in place.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>I further learned more about UI elements. I also learned a bit about the 3rd party package we are
					using, as I had to make tweaks to it to allow this menu to work.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>Same with last week, I hope to start working on the video streaming side of the project, or work on
					making the simulation work well with the real arm once that is working. If these are unable to be
					worked on yet again, I can continue to make improvements on the simulation.

				<b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Synopsis</p>
				<p>This week Emma got the arm working with the server somewhat, so I did some work on calibrating the
					angle values. I also edited some scripts, like the gripper script, to allow us to debug the
					calibration.

				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Calibration</p>
				<p> Calibration requires us to test the arm with the simulation, and edit the sim so that it matches up
					with the arm correctly. The way we chose to do this was via offsets, since its the simplest way to
					do this. I also changed the way the claw works in the simulation so that I can manually change the
					value of that joint.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>These next weeks I am going to be focusing on calibrating the arm. Also, when Matthew gets the video
					streaming up, I will work on that too.

				<h4>Week 11:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 3/25/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Synopsis</p>
				<p>This week, Emma and I further worked on the arm. I changed some things in the code to work more with
					the arm we have currently. We also modified the arm to better match what the arm should look like.
					Overall, we got the base arm working properly.

				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Calibration</p>
				<p> We did more work on calibrating the arm to align the simulation with the physical arm. This required
					making various changes to the code, including offsets and flipping some rotational values. Here is a
					diagram of what we need the arm to move like:
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week11/diagram.jpg" />
				<p>(red/blue = -90/90 degrees, gray = software limits)</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Modifying Arm</p>
				<p> Based on how our calibration worked out, as well as the arm physically, we had to make changes to
					the motors to make sure the -90 to 90 degree limits were actually within the bounds of what we
					needed. In other words, we had to rotate some of the motors so that their 0-degree positions matched
					the simulation.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week11/calib.jpg" />
				<p>This is what the arm looked like after we changed it, which matches up with the above diagram.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>Emma made more changes to the arm, including adding the extra motor, so the plan next week is to make
					sure the complete arm works properly, once that is done, the arm should be fully functional, without
					any changes needing to be made.

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Synopsis</p>
				<p>This week, Emma and I modified the arm to add the extra joints we were missing, and calibrated it a
					bit. We also did research into how to make our arm more stable.

				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">New Arm + Calibration</p>
				<p> After adding the joints to the arm, we did some slight calibration to make sure the joints are at
					least somewhat in the same location as shown in the simulation. There is still much work to be done
					in this aspect, but it is usable for now.

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"></p>
				<p> At this point, we have the full arm built, all that needs to be done at this point is stabilizing
					the arm, and improving the software. We did a lot of research into stabilizing the first joint, as
					that one was tilting due to the arm not having all the parts. After consulting the internet
					and faculty, we decided to try to use lazy susan ball bearings.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week12/bearing.png" />
				<p>These are the look of the bearings we bought, which should be good to stabilize it. (if we can attach
					it)
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>Next week, I will do some camera work if Matt has made progress. I will also be soldering some wires
					together so that the motor cables are longer, as currently they are a bit short. I will also be
					trying to figure out how to add the lazy susan ball bearings to the first joint to stabilize it.

				<h4>Week 13:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 4/08/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 15<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Synopsis</p>
				<p>This week, Matt and I did a lot of work towards the video streaming side of the project. We got the
					video working, at a decent speed and latency, the only downside being resolution. I also attached
					the lazy susan ball bearing to the robot arm base, so we should have more stability between the
					first and second joint.

				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Video Streaming</p>
				<p> Matt and I finally got the Raspberry Pi to stream data to the server then into Unity. The quality
					isn't the highest, but for our current solution (putting the camera at the end of the arm) this
					shouldn't be much of a problem. Matt is dedicated to making the camera quality better, so we will
					see how that turns out in the future.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/blatimer/week13/delay.png" />
				<p>Here's a screenshot of the delay/quality of the camera. As you can see, there is only about a 0.3
					second delay from the camera to the simulation.</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Adding the Ball Bearing</p>
				<p> I figured out a good way to add the ball bearing to the robot arm to give it the stability it needs.
					Ended up having to drill some holes to get the thing to screw in for two holes, but overall it is
					very stable, and hopefully will provide the stability we need with no downsides. All that's left is
					gluing the base plate on top of the bearing, and rebuilding the arm.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>Next week, Emma and I will attempt to rebuild the arm with the added stability. Matt and I will
					continue to improve the video streaming side of the project.
