				<h4>Week 2:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 1/21/2022<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 15<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
					<p>My main goals for the week were to set up the base website for our team, and to discuss and solidify
						how we plan to have each component of our system work in tandem through the creation of a system level
						diagram. I also worked with Matthew on transitioning our ECESS API into one that can be used with this
						project.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Website</p>
					<p>This ended up being a much simpler task than expected, as a template was readily available to us for
						us to fill in. Aside from figuring out how to access the web hosted files for our team and moving these
						files to a private repository where the team members could all collaborate without having to sign into
						a remote machine, the only step that was needed was to implement a continuous deployment system that would
						automatically deploy our changes to the website upon updating the repository, which was accomplished with
						the help of Matthew.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">System Level Diagram</p>
					<p>As with any engineering undertaking, it's critical that everyone on the team is on the same page in terms
						of their understanding of our system's understanding. To aid with this, as well as at the request of course
						staff, I made a very simple system level diagram to aid in the visualization of our systems functionality.
						In particular, our system has multiple components that will be in constant communication with each other
						using a variety of protocols. Some of this communication will be direct, such as transmitting video feed
						from the robot arm to the VR headset, while others will require some computation, such as when converting
						hand remote position information from the VR headset to arm movement instructions that the robot arm can
						carry out. Our first draft of our system level diagram can be seen below.
					</p>
					<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week2/SystemDiagram1.png" />
					<p>This system diagram shows the general flow of data throughout the components of our system. As shown, the VR
						headset and controller will communicate with the arm through the assistance of a Google Cloud virtual machine
						and a Raspberry Pi. The Google Cloud VM will take positional data from the VR headset and convert it to
						movement instructions for the robot arm, while simultaneously streaming video from the arm to the VR headset.
						TCP Websockets will be used to transfer video streaming data, while TCP MQTT will be used to transmit movement
						data, as MQTT is better suited for efficient transfer of smaller data sizes. The Raspberry Pi will be used to
						interface the hardware on the arm with the wireless connection to the Google Cloud server. We have discussed
						the possibilities of using UDP for communications in the future, but we think that this will be a good launching
						point for us to begin with.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DevOps Continuous Integration and Deployment with API Gateway</p>
					<p>Our project will rely heavily on an API for communications between components. This API can be found 
						<a href="https://github.com/477-vrms/vrms-api">here</a>
						. It is a based off of the ECESS (Electrical and Computer Engineering Student Society) API gateway developed by
						Matthew and me, which can be found
						<a href="https://github.com/Purdue-ECESS/ecess-api">here</a>
						. A big reason that we copied a large portion this API over is because it handles a lot of the housekeeping that
						we will need to be dealing with constantly with our code, much of this having to do with the continuous Integration
						pipeline that we want to have set up for our project. It will also allow us to interface with Google Cloud Platform
						for the deployment of our server-side code, which will become the backbone of how data is handled in our project
						(as seen in our system diagram).
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
					<p>Through the creation of the system diagram and discussion with my teammates, I gained a much greater understanding
						of our project's components and their interactions. Ultimately, I feel that this will really help in preparing
						me to move forward with our project's development and will help me to keep up to date on the functionality of the
						components that my teammates are working on.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
					<p>My main goal for next week is to gain an understanding of Unity so that I will be able to assist Brian with the
						development of the VR arm controller. I plan not only to work on my general understanding of Unity, but also to
						dig through the existing simulations that Brian has already created to get a better understanding of how our
						project specific code is driven. Aside from this, I plan to continue working with Matthew on the development and
						implementation of our API onto the Google Cloud Platform.

					<h4>Week 3:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 1/28/2022<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
					<p>My main goals for the week were to get familiar with Unity, play around with our project workspace, and try and
						control the arm simulation using a VR setup in lab.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Unity</p>
					<p>Setting up Unity was a simple process. All I really had to do was install the Unity Hub on my computer, create
						an account, and then open up the project files that Brian set up. After doing all of this, I was able to access
						the arm simulation just like Brian has been, as seen in the screenshot below. Through this I am able to manually
						drag the arm around and see how it effects the data being sent to our server, and how that data will talk to the
						robot arm.
					</p>
					<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week2/Simulation1.png" />

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Set Up VR</p>
					<p>This one was a lot more fun that it was work. After we got the simulation above up and running on our lab computer,
						we were simply able to plug in and set up the VR headset in the lab. Once everything was set up and installed, we
						were able to try our simulation actually using the VR. While everything works quite well, we did find there to be
						a bit of lag in the video. The response time of the arm movement was fine, but the video feed itself seemed to be
						quite choppy. This is definitely something that we'll need to look into moving forward in order to make sure that
						the arm can function as smooth as possible.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
					<p>I'm really excited to have gotten my feet wet with Unity, and I plan to keep learning as the project progresses.
						Also, it was really nice to see first-hand the simulation working in full VR. I really like the way that things
						are looking, and I have high hopes for us moving forward.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
					<p>My main goal for next week is to gain an understanding of PCB design. While Emma is mainly in charge of the process,
						I definitely want to be available to help wherever I can, so I plan to go through all of the PCB training materials
						over the course of the week. I also plan to keep working on the software side and will likely be looking into ways
						to timestamp our data so that we can ensure that things get processed in the correct order.

					<h4>Week 4:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 2/4/2022<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 12<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
					<p>My main goal for the week was to complete the mechanical overview, which includes deciding on the packaging for our
						hardware as well as creating CAD models, and also creating a basic PCB layout footprint.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Packaging</p>
					<p>No matter the hardware, in order to safely deliver the product, everything must be packaged in a way that will protect
						the internals of the product and assist in its usability. For our project, the main feature will be an exposed robot
						arm, which doesn't need any packaging. So, the packaging for our product is going to be fairly simple, as the only
						thing that really needs protection is our PCB, Raspberry Pi, and any other exposed hardware for the arm. To do this,
						we can use a simple box that will protect these elements while providing an opening for any cables or connectors.
						There are many of these currently on the market that we could simply buy instead of having to make our own, but to
						illustrate what we are looking for I used CAD to make an example to our dimensions. I used a parameterized
						version of 
						<a href="this">https://github.com/477-vrms/vrms-api/runs/4872020682?check_suite_focus=true</a> design to fit our
						needs of a 13x10x8cm box. We plan on mounting this to the base of our robot arm.
					</p>
					<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week4/box1.png" />
					<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week4/box2.png" />

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PCB Layout Footprint</p>
					<p>While there is a lot to PCB design, I was tasked this week with creating a very simple layout footprint for our PCB.
						Nearly all of the design still has to be done, but this gives us a general idea of what we need to include on our PCB.
						For our PCB we're going to keep it simple, since we will have a lot of help from our Raspberry Pi. Our PCB will include
						our STM micro alongside a buzzer and its MOSFET, with 5 screw terminals (3 for the arm, 2 for the buzzer). The layout
						can be seen below. All of our elements will fit on a 5x8cm board.
						<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week4/pcb.png" />
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
					<p>I have always really enjoyed playing around with CAD, but I've only had a couple of chances to do so for school projects,
						so I had a lot of fun researching and editing designs for our hardware box. I also used KiCad for the first time,
						which was a really nice learning experience. I plan on helping with the actual PCB design in the future, so it was
						to get my feet wet in KiCad with something simple.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
					<p>My main goal for next week is to keep working on the PCB training videos. Having started using KiCad this week, I don't
						think I'll have any issues picking up the software. On top of this, I plan on being available for any help that Emma,
						Brian, and Matthew might need, so I'll be sure to keep in communication with them and keep my plan flexible.

					<h4>Week 5:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 2/11/2022<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week / Summary</p>
					<p>My main goal for the week was to complete more of the PCB training as well as be available to assist the team as they
						work on their parts of the project. Through my general learning about PCB's, I was able to create a basic layout
						footprint last week, as seen in the following figure.
						<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week4/pcb.png" />
						However, I discovered that I would be needing an additional connector for the purpose of programming our microcontroller
						once It's on the chip. With this in mind, I will likely need to adjust our layout footprint not only to fit the new
						connector, but also to more efficiently make connections between pins of the micro and the other devices/connectors on
						the PCB. I don't know enough to confidently do this yet, but I certainly expect to get this done in the next couple of
						weeks.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PCB Updates</p>
					<p>As I mentioned above, we will need to make some design changes in the layout footprint for our PCB. When I made the
						original layout, my main goal was to include all of the devices/connections we will need, and space them in an orderly
						manner. Since we didn't yet know the exact pins of the micro we will be using, as well as the fact that we didn't know
						we would need a connector just to program the micro, our current design is lacking, and will need to be updated. While
						I would like to be able to do this immediately so we could lock down our footprint and simply focus on the design of
						our circuit, I think doing so would be premature. There's a lot that we don't know yet in terms of what aspects of the
						micro we will be using, as all of the work we have done so far with the micro has been with the development board.
						Therefore, I think it would be wiser for me to instead continue my research and training on PCB's and wait to update our
						design until we are sure about what we need. Otherwise, time will likely end up getting wasted having to make the new
						diagram, understand its flaws, and then make yet another iteration. Most of my effort this next week will be focused on
						continuing the PCB training. Our current plan is for me to learn as much of the software as I can, and for Emma to
						understand the design of the circuit, what parts of our micro will need to be used, etc. This way, she can tell me what
						needs to happen, and I can design the PCB to her specifications.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
					<p>I have continued to learn about PCB design, and what that entails for our project. With this in mind I am better prepared
						to continue the PCB training material, since in the back of my mind I'll have a better idea of what to look out for with
						our project and what to expect when bringing our PCB to life.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
					<p>My main goal for next week is very similar to this past week. I will focus on the PCB training material, while also
						staying available for any help that Brian, Emma, and Matthew might need. Hopefully at the end of next week, I'll have a
						better understanding of what I need to do fix our PCB layout, and in communication with Emma, I hope to be able to
						produce an updated layout footprint that will better suit our needs.

					<h4>Week 6:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 2/18/2022<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 15<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week / Summary</p>
					<p>My main goal for the week was to nearly complete our PCB design. While I didn't have all of the information I need to
						fully complete the PCB design, I wanted to get it as close as I can so that I will have time to make any last minute
						before our design review. Emma has completed our schematic, with a couple of things subject to change, so I have had a
						really solid foundation to be building my design off of. I have gotten our PCB design close to the schematic, with a
						few points of ambiguity that I need to clear up with Emma. Based on how things are going so far, I feel very confident
						moving forward that we will be able to complete our PCB on time.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PCB Updates</p>
					<p>Designing the PCB hasn't been very difficult so far thanks to Emma's schematic. While I feel like I am on the right
						track, there are a couple of things that I feel like I need to clear up with Emma so I can be certain moving forward.
						For example, it is currently ambiguous whether or not the VDD output of the JTAG is supposed to connect to 3.3V or 5V.
						Another thing I need to get cleared up is the type of switch used in the reset logic. Right now I have a generic button,
						but I can change it to be something specific of there is already one laying around in the lab that we can use. In
						addition, I'm unsure about the type of JTAG connector that we're using, since I can't find a KiCad footprint for the one
						in the schematic. The same needs to be done for the transistor that we use. The exact type of buzzer is another thing I
						need to get locked down so that my footprint can be as accurate as possible. Finally, I feel like the 3.3V pins at the
						top of the schematic might be shifted one pin to the left, since I don't think we need the VBAT pin but I believe we do
						need the VDDA pin. Fianlly, I'm having a difficult time finding the LTC3638 in KiCad, so we'll need to figure out how to
						make that work. Here's our incomplete PCB design at the time of writing. It's currently missing a couple of connections,
						decoupling capacitors, and power management blocks.
						<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week5/pcb.png" />
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
					<p>Through working on the PCB design my biggest struggle has been finding exact parts. KiCad doesn't always have a footprint
						for the parts that we're planning on using, which makes things pretty difficult to match the PCB design to the schematic.
						I have also just generally been getting better at using KiCad, and I have been enjoying the challenge of design a PCB to
						this point.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
					<p>My main goal for next week is to complete the PCB design. To do so I'll need to sort out the ambiguities that I mentioned
						earlier, but if I can do that then I don't see any reason why we won't be set to move forward with working on our project.

					<h4>Week 7:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 2/25/2022<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 15<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week / Summary</p>
					<p>My main goal for the week was to finish up our PCB design as much as possible. Thanks to working with Emma and meeting
						outside of our weekly lab time with Joe to review our PCB and schematic, I feel really good about where we sit in terms
						of our PCB design. The only thing left to add is our power module, which we decided to buy a premade module since
						implementing the power steps ourselves looked like it would be an unnecessary amount of work. Our most recent PCB layout
						can be seen below, with filled zones such as planes and test points left as outlines to provide a better view of the
						design.
						<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week6/pcb.png" />
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PCB Updates</p>
					<p>As you can see from the image above, our PCB looks quite a bit different from last time. Joe provided us with a number of
						really helpful changes this past week. For starters, I beefed up the power/ground traces in order to better support our
						current flow. Next, I changed the size of all of our capacitors and resistors to 0805. I also moved in the decoupling
						capacitors for more efficient power flow. Finally, I added a ground plane with a proper clearance and mounting holes with
						exclusion zones. There were also some changes on the schematic side that Emma took care of, but I still had to update the
						PCB to match the schematic. These changes include adding some pull up/pull down resistors, adding current limiting resistors
						on the UART connections, breaking out some spare GPIO pins, adding a ground signal to the UART lines, and updating the
						buzzer footprint to match the actual buzzer we will be using. The only thing left in the schematic is to implement the
						module, which I will then replicate on the PCB.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
					<p>Designing the PCB has been a constant learning experience, and I have still enjoyed the challenge of stepping outside of my
						comfort zone to tackle this part of the project. I have become much more comfortable with KiCad, and I have gained a lot of
						insight on what goes into making a PCB thanks to conversations with Emma and Joe. While the PCB is almost done and while
						our PCB is very simple in comparison to many other teams, I still look forward to finishing this part of our project off
						and seeing what else is left for me to learn.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
					<p>My main goal for next week is to complete the PCB design and our midterm presentation. To do so I'll need to get the updated
						schematic with the new power module from Emma, and I'll work with the rest of the team to organize and deliver our review.
						Overall, I'm really happy with the work we've done, and I feel really good about moving forward from here.

					<h4>Week 9:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 3/11/2022<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week / Summary</p>
					<p>My main goal for the week was to order our PCB. Having had everything reviewed by course staff, we were given the go-ahead
						to create our Gerber files and submit them to OSH Park for ordering. I also helped Matthew to debug our camera issues, as
						we are now able to capture images using the Pi camera module.
					</p>
					
					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PCB Updates</p>
					<p>Our PCB is officially ordered! Having made the edits given to us during our design presentation (creating pads that won't
						get covered by soldermask and putting a pin 1 marker on our micro footprint), we were given the go-ahead from course staff
						during our weekly lab period to order our PCB. Doing this was fairly simple, but it took time to check things over and over
						again because I needed to get things right the first time. Basically I just had to generate the Gerber files in KiCad, and
						in the built in Gerber viewer, I checked all of the layers and drills to make sure that everything lined up as I expected.
						Then, I was able to upload these files to OSH Park, and that was it! Below is a rendering of how our PCB will look.
						<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week8/Olivia.jpg" />
						I thought adding the logo was a nice touch. Plus, it's purple, which Matthew says is the Olivia Rodrigo color.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
					<p>Submitting the PCB for manufacturing was really satisfying for me. Having never touched a PCB, I went from having no knowledge
						to completing the entire lifecycle of PCB development with the help of Emma's schematic. Overall, I really enjoyed the PCB
						development experience, and I'm excited to see how the skilled I gained will serve me in the future, whether from a hobby
						standpoint or in industry, despite my heading towards a software job.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
					<p>I'm really looking forward to our first Spring break since 2020. I definitely need the time off to recharge before the second
						half of the semester. When I come back, with the PCB done, I'll be available to help out Matthew, Brian, and Emma in whatever
						way they need.

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week / Summary</p>
					<p>My main goal for the week was to verify our components fit on our PCB in lab, as well as complete the Legal and Regulatory
						Analysis and submit for grading.
					</p>
					
					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PCB Updates</p>
					<p>Our PCBs came in, as well as all of our electrical components that will be on the PCB. After quickly placing the parts on the
						board, we were able to verify that all of our footprints are correct, so we are ready to start soldering. Learning to solder
						is something that I will be putting an emphasis on for next week. I also was able to verify that there are no shorts between
						any of the power and ground leads on the board.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Legal and Regulatory Analysis</p>
					<p>Using our initial proposal, I was able to hold our product up against a number of certifications as well as various existing
						products and patents to see how our project stacks up. While it would certainly be a process to make everything official, it's
						good to know that if our project was distributed in the real world then we would be able to do so without stepping on any toes.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
					<p>I have begun the process of learning to solder and have gained a better understanding to the legal and regulatory side of
						engineering. Also finally seeing the PCBs was a really satisfying way to cap the PCB production process.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
					<p>As I mentioned earlier, my main goal moving forward is to learn how to solder so that we can implement our PCB.

					<h4>Week 12:</h4>
					<b>Date:</b> 4/1/2022<br>
					<b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
					<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week / Summary</p>
					<p>My main goal for the week was to get the Raspberry Pi camera to work again and to assemble and verify our power block for our
						PCB.
					</p>
					
					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PCB Updates</p>
					<p>This week I spent a lot of time doing research on how to solder, and thanks to Joe's help I think I'm starting to get the hang
						of it. So far, I've soldered all of the components that have to do with power on our PCB, and I was able to verify that our PCB
						is powered as expected. I've been practicing drag soldering, which is a way to solder microcontrollers, and once I'm confident
						I'll go ahead and solder our microcontroller to the PCB.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Pi Camera</p>
					<p>I also spent some time with Matthew trouble shooting the camera for the Raspberry Pi. We figured out that there were some
						conflicting configurations that were causing an error when we tried to use the camera. To fix this, we had to do a clean install
						of the Pi OS, and then after tweaking some configurations we were able to get the camera to work again!
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
					<p>I learned how to solder, which I'm really excited about since I've never done it and sice it's a really cool skill to have. I also
						learned more about the Pi after spending time messing around with it and debugging it, as I've also never used a Pi before this.
					</p>

					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
					<p>My main goal for next week is to get as much of the PCB assembly done as possible.
