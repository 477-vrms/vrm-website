            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 1/21/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 15<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
				<p>My main goals for the week were to set up the base website for our team, and to discuss and solidify
					how we plan to have each component of our system work in tandem through the creation of a system level
					diagram. I also worked with Matthew on transitioning our ECESS API into one that can be used with this
					project.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Website</p>
				<p>This ended up being a much simpler task than expected, as a template was readily available to us for
					us to fill in. Aside from figuring out how to access the web hosted files for our team and moving these
					files to a private repository where the team members could all collaborate without having to sign into
					a remote machine, the only step that was needed was to implement a continuous deployment system that would
					automatically deploy our changes to the website upon updating the repository, which was accomplished with
					the help of Matthew.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">System Level Diagram</p>
				<p>As with any engineering undertaking, it's critical that everyone on the team is on the same page in terms
					of their understanding of our system's understanding. To aid with this, as well as at the request of course
					staff, I made a very simple system level diagram to aid in the visualization of our systems functionality.
					In particular, our system has multiple components that will be in constant communication with each other
					using a variety of protocols. Some of this communication will be direct, such as transmitting video feed
					from the robot arm to the VR headset, while others will require some computation, such as when converting
					hand remote position information from the VR headset to arm movement instructions that the robot arm can
					carry out. Our first draft of our system level diagram can be seen below.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week2/SystemDiagram1.png" />
				<p>This system diagram shows the general flow of data throughout the components of our system. As shown, the VR
					headset and controller will communicate with the arm through the assistance of a Google Cloud virtual machine
					and a Raspberry Pi. The Google Cloud VM will take positional data from the VR headset and convert it to
					movement instructions for the robot arm, while simultaneously streaming video from the arm to the VR headset.
					TCP Websockets will be used to transfer video streaming data, while TCP MQTT will be used to transmit movement
					data, as MQTT is better suited for efficient transfer of smaller data sizes. The Raspberry Pi will be used to
					interface the hardware on the arm with the wireless connection to the Google Cloud server. We have discussed
					the possibilities of using UDP for communications in the future, but we think that this will be a good launching
					point for us to begin with.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DevOps Continuous Integration and Deployment with API Gateway</p>
				<p>Our project will rely heavily on an API for communications between components. This API can be found 
					<a href="https://github.com/477-vrms/vrms-api">here</a>
					. It is a based off of the ECESS (Electrical and Computer Engineering Student Society) API gateway developed by
					Matthew and me, which can be found
					<a href="https://github.com/Purdue-ECESS/ecess-api">here</a>
					. A big reason that we copied a large portion this API over is because it handles a lot of the housekeeping that
					we will need to be dealing with constantly with our code, much of this having to do with the continuous Integration
					pipeline that we want to have set up for our project. It will also allow us to interface with Google Cloud Platform
					for the deployment of our server-side code, which will become the backbone of how data is handled in our project
					(as seen in our system diagram).
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>Through the creation of the system diagram and discussion with my teammates, I gained a much greater understanding
					of our project's components and their interactions. Ultimately, I feel that this will really help in preparing
					me to move forward with our project's development and will help me to keep up to date on the functionality of the
					components that my teammates are working on.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>My main goal for next week is to gain an understanding of Unity so that I will be able to assist Brian with the
					development of the VR arm controller. I plan not only to work on my general understanding of Unity, but also to
					dig through the existing simulations that Brian has already created to get a better understanding of how our
					project specific code is driven. Aside from this, I plan to continue working with Matthew on the development and
					implementation of our API onto the Google Cloud Platform.
				</p>
            
				<h4>Week 3:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 1/28/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
				<p>My main goals for the week were to get familiar with Unity, play around with our project workspace, and try and
					control the arm simulation using a VR setup in lab.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Unity</p>
				<p>Setting up Unity was a simple process. All I really had to do was install the Unity Hub on my computer, create
					an account, and then open up the project files that Brian set up. After doing all of this, I was able to access
					the arm simulation just like Brian has been, as seen in the screenshot below. Through this I am able to manually
					drag the arm around and see how it effects the data being sent to our server, and how that data will talk to the
					robot arm.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week2/Simulation1.png" />

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Set Up VR</p>
				<p>This one was a lot more fun that it was work. After we got the simulation above up and running on our lab computer,
					we were simply able to plug in and set up the VR headset in the lab. Once everything was set up and installed, we
					were able to try our simulation actually using the VR. While everything works quite well, we did find there to be
					a bit of lag in the video. The response time of the arm movement was fine, but the video feed itself seemed to be
					quite choppy. This is definitely something that we'll need to look into moving forward in order to make sure that
					the arm can function as smooth as possible.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>I'm really excited to have gotten my feet wet with Unity, and I plan to keep learning as the project progresses.
					Also, it was really nice to see first-hand the simulation working in full VR. I really like the way that things
					are looking, and I have high hopes for us moving forward.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>My main goal for next week is to gain an understanding of PCB design. While Emma is mainly in charge of the process,
					I definitely want to be available to help wherever I can, so I plan to go through all of the PCB training materials
					over the course of the week. I also plan to keep working on the software side and will likely be looking into ways
					to timestamp our data so that we can ensure that things get processed in the correct order.
				</p>

				<h4>Week 4:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 2/4/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 12<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
				<p>My main goal for the week was to complete the mechanical overview, which includes deciding on the packaging for our
					hardware as well as creating CAD models, and also creating a basic PCB layout footprint.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Packaging</p>
				<p>No matter the hardware, in order to safely deliver the product, everything must be packaged in a way that will protect
					the internals of the product and assist in its usability. For our project, the main feature will be an exposed robot
					arm, which doesn't need any packaging. So, the packaging for our product is going to be fairly simple, as the only
					thing that really needs protection is our PCB, Raspberry Pi, and any other exposed hardware for the arm. To do this,
					we can use a simple box that will protect these elements while providing an opening for any cables or connectors.
					There are many of these currently on the market that we could simply buy instead of having to make our own, but to
					illustrate what we are looking for I used CAD to make an example to our dimensions. I used a parameterized
					version of 
					<a href="this">https://github.com/477-vrms/vrms-api/runs/4872020682?check_suite_focus=true</a> design to fit our
					needs of a 13x10x8cm box. We plan on mounting this to the base of our robot arm.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week4/box1.png" />
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week4/box2.png" />

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PCB Layout Footprint</p>
				<p>While there is a lot to PCB design, I was tasked this week with creating a very simple layout footprint for our PCB.
					Nearly all of the design still has to be done, but this gives us a general idea of what we need to include on our PCB.
					For our PCB we're going to keep it simple, since we will have a lot of help from our Raspberry Pi. Our PCB will incude
					our STM micro alongside a buzzer and its MOSFET, with 5 screw terminals (3 for the arm, 2 for the buzzer). The layout
					can be seen below. All of our elements will fit on a 5x8cm board.
					<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week4/pcb.png" />
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>I have always really ejoyed playing around with CAD, but I've only had a couple of chances to do so for school projects,
					so I had a lot of fun reasearching and editing designs for our hardware box. I also used KiCad for the first time,
					which was a really nice learning experience. I plan on helping with the actual PCB design in the future, so it was
					to get my feet wet in KiCad with something simple.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>My main goal for next week is to keep working on the PCB training videos. Having started using KiCad this week, I don't
					think I'll have any issues picking up the software. On top of this, I plan on being available for any help that Emma,
					Brian, and Matthew might need, so I'll be sure to keep in communication with them and keep my plan flexible.
