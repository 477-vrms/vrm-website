            <h4>Week 2:</h4>

				<b>Total hours:</b> 15<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
				<p>My main goals for the week were to set up the base website for our team, and to discuss and solidify
					how we plan to have each component of our system work in tandem through the creation of a system level
					diagram. I also worked with Matthew on transitioning our ECESS API into one that can be used with this
					project.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Website</p>
				<p>This ended up being a much simpler task than expected, as a template was readily available to us for
					us to fill in. Aside from figuring out how to access the web hosted files for our team and moving these
					files to a private repository where the team members could all collaborate without having to sign into
					a remote machine, the only step that was needed was to implement a continuous deployment system that would
					automatically deploy our changes to the website upon updating the repository, which was accomplished with
					the help of Matthew.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">System Level Diagram</p>
				<p>As with any engineering undertaking, it's critical that everyone on the team is on the same page in terms
					of their understanding of our system's understanding. To aid with this, as well as at the request of course
					staff, I made a very simple system level diagram to aid in the visualization of our systems functionality.
					In particular, our system has multiple components that will be in constant communication with each other
					using a variety of protocols. Some of this communication will be direct, such as transmitting video feed
					from the robot arm to the VR headset, while others will require some computation, such as when converting
					hand remote position information from the VR headset to arm movement instructions that the robot arm can
					carry out. Our first draft of our system level diagram can be seen below.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week2/SystemDiagram1.png" />
				<p>This system diagram shows the general flow of data throughout the components of our system. As shown, the VR
					headset and controller will communicate with the arm through the assistance of a Google Cloud virtual machine
					and a Raspberry Pi. The Google Cloud VM will take positional data from the VR headset and convert it to
					movement instructions for the robot arm, while simultaneously streaming video from the arm to the VR headset.
					TCP Websockets will be used to transfer video streaming data, while TCP MQTT will be used to transmit movement
					data, as MQTT is better suited for efficient transfer of smaller data sizes. The Raspberry Pi will be used to
					interface the hardware on the arm with the wireless connection to the Google Cloud server. We have discussed
					the possibilities of using UDP for communications in the future, but we think that this will be a good launching
					point for us to begin with.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DevOps Continuous Integration and Deployment with API Gateway</p>
				<p>Our project will rely heavily on an API for communications between components. This API can be found 
					<a href="https://github.com/477-vrms/vrms-api">here</a>
					. It is a based off of the ECESS (Electrical and Computer Engineering Student Society) API gateway developed by
					Matthew and me, which can be found
					<a href="https://github.com/Purdue-ECESS/ecess-api">here</a>
					. A big reason that we copied a large portion this API over is because it handles a lot of the housekeeping that
					we will need to be dealing with constantly with our code, much of this having to do with the continuous Integration
					pipeline that we want to have set up for our project. It will also allow us to interface with Google Cloud Platform
					for the deployment of our server-side code, which will become the backbone of how data is handled in our project
					(as seen in our system diagram).
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>Through the creation of the system diagram and discussion with my teammates, I gained a much greater understanding
					of our project's components and their interactions. Ultimately, I feel that this will really help in preparing
					me to move forward with our project's development and will help me to keep up to date on the functionality of the
					components that my teammates are working on.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>My main goal for next week is to gain an understanding of Unity so that I will be able to assist Brian with the
					development of the VR arm controller. I plan not only to work on my general understanding of Unity, but also to
					dig through the existing simulations that Brian has already created to get a better understanding of how our
					project specific code is driven. Aside from this, I plan to continue working with Matthew on the development and
					implementation of our API onto the Google Cloud Platform.
				</p>
            
				<h4>Week 3:</h4>
				<b>Date:</b> 1/28/2022<br>
				<b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
				<p>My main goals for the week were to get familiar with Unity, play around with our project workspace, and try and
					control the arm simulation using a VR setup in lab.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Unity</p>
				<p>Setting up Unity was a simple process. All I really had to do was install the Unity Hub on my computer, create
					an account, and then open up the project files that Brian set up. After doing all of this, I was able to access
					the arm simuation just like Brian has been, as seen in the screenshot below. Through this I am able to manually
					drag the arm around and see how it effects the data being sent to our server, and how that data will talk to the
					robot arm.
				</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="Files/img/donnell9/week2/Simulation1.png" />

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Set Up VR</p>
				<p>This one was a lot more fun that it was work. After we got the simulation above up and running on our lab computer,
					we were simply able to plug in and set up the VR headset in the lab. Once everything was set up and installed, we
					were able to try our simulation actually using the VR. While everything works quite well, we did find there to be
					a bit of lag in the video. The response time of the arm movement was fine, but the video feed itself seemed to be
					quite choppy. This is definitely something that we'll need to look into moving forward in order to make sure that
					the arm can function as smooth as possible.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">What I Learned</p>
				<p>I'm really excited to have gotten my feet wet with Unity, and I plan to keep learning as the project progresses.
					Also, it was really nice to see first hand the simulation working in full VR. I really like the way that things
					are looking, and I have high hopes for us moving forward.
				</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Next Week</p>
				<p>My main goal for next week is to gain an understanding of PCB design. While Emma is mainly in charge of the process,
					I definitely want to be available to help wherever I can, so I plan to go through all of the PCB training materials
					over the course of the week. I also plan to keep working on the software side, and will likely be looking into ways
					to timestamp our data so that we can ensure that things get processed in the correct order.
