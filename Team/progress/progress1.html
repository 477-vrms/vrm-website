 	    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
            <p>I spent this week working on setting up the robot arm that we rented from the lab and working on different ways of communicating with the servos. Once I could control the robot arm via Bluetooth (Built in IOS app), I broke out an Arduino uno to quickly prototype the serial connection between a controller and the 6-servo controller that came with the robot arm. Even though we are unable to utilize an Arduino in our final prototype, I set it up so that Brian would be able to test out the unity data while I work on setting up a serial communication on the STM32 development board. The LeArm robot kit came with built in Arduino Uno libraries that supported serial communication between the Arduino uno and the servo driver, so I felt it was worth the time spent to set up this prototype to make sure Brian wasnâ€™t blocked in his progress. I also researched the Raspberry-Pi wifi module and the STM32 development board capabilities. </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">How did the student work on it? </p>
            <p> Most of my time was spent researching the specifications of the LeArm Robot Kit by searching through the user manuals, videos, and advanced communication tutorials. The remainder of my time was spent setting up the serial connection between the Arduino Uno and the servo driver using the tutorial. I used the LeArm app, Arduino IDE, LeArm manuals, and LeArm videos to complete this task. <\p>
		    
            <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"> What was the result, and how does this affect the project?  </p>
            <p> I successfully set up the communication between the Arduino Uno and the robot arm, so the team is now able to type in a number 0-2500 in the Arduino program for each individual servo (2-8) and controls the position of the servo once the program is compiled and uploaded to the Arduino.  The photo to the right is the LeArm app that they developed for the arm. The range for the servos is displayed there (0-2500). As I said above, this is temporary so the Software team can test the Unity data points while I develop the same Serial Communication using the STM32 development board. </p>

  	    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"> What are the next steps that must be taken? </p>
            <p> The next step is to replace the Arduino with the STM32 development board and test communication between the development board and the servos. After communication is tested and is verified to be correctly sending positional data, I need to connect the Raspberry-Pi to the STM32 development board using a serial communication protocol to transfer the Unity positional data directly to the STM32 board. </p>

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> Jan 27, 2022<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 20 hours <br>

 	    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Main Goals for the Week</p>
            <p>I spent this week setting up the microcontroller environment, experimenting with the PWM functionality of the STM32, researching UART and SPI protocols, and ordering parts. </p>
           
 	    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">How did the student work on it? </p>
            <p> Most of my time at the start of the week was spent setting up the microcontroller environment. I originally was going to use workbench like we did in ECE362, but I switched to the CubeIDE workspace since it had a superior UI. Once I downloaded and set up the initial preferences for the CubeIDE, I started with a basic PWM program to refresh on how to write programs for the STM32 breakout board. I had to reread quite a bit of the ECE362 lectures to refresh myself on a couple of important topics, but once I familiarized myself with the process again, I got the PWM program working. I set it to a 50% duty cycle and captured it with an AD2 scope to ensure it was working correctly.  <\p>
		    
            <img style="width: 50%;" src="Files/img/progress1/week2/pwmpng.jpg"/> 

            <p> Next I started to work on ordering new parts for the robot arm so that we can convert it to a 8 dof robot arm instead of the 6 dof arm it is now. This involves ordering 2 extra servos and some brackets to attach in the 5 and 6 position in the diagram below. </p>

            <img style="width: 50%;" src="Files/img/progress1/week2/diagrampng.png"/>
	    <p> Since we have more than 6 servos now, we needed a driver that would support that many servo drivers. After researching, I found a 16-channel servo controller. I also ordered the raspberry pi camera and case seen below. </p>

	    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"> What was the result, and how does this affect the project?  </p>
	    <p> Now that I have successfully set up the microcontroller, AD2 scope, and ordered all of the materials we need, our project can really start coming together quickly. The PWM will be used for the motor on the bottom of the robot arm to give the arm 360 degrees of rotation, and it will also be used to control the buzzer whenever the server is disconnected.  </p>
  	    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"> What are the next steps that must be taken? </p>
	    <p> The next step is to set up UART communication between the microcontroller and the servo driver. After that, an SPI or UART communication between the microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi will need to be established too.   </p>
