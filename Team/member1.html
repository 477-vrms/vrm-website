	Emma Clary is a Computer Engineering major. She has experience in robotics, embedded software development, and electromechanical projects from various internships and clubs. She was a team leader on her FIRST robotics team during high school, giving her a chance to develop different skills that are needed for a complex robotics project. She also worked on an electromechanical project at Allegion which required embedded programming and design.
